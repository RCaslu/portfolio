        I started my programming journey during the first semester of my Computer Science degree. My first contact with development was with Python, a language that sparked my curiosity and desire to learn. Thanks to a relative, I had the opportunity to take on my first freelance project, creating a website for a popular restaurant in Guar√°. Despite my inexperience, I accepted the challenge, and after a period of intense study, I was able to deliver software that is still in use today. Since that moment, I fell in love with development and continue to evolve, seeking to learn everything I dont know and improve my skills.

        My goal is to acquire new experiences and grow as a developer. I am focused on making my code more efficient and my structures more sophisticated, always following the best practices of architecture and clean code. I believe that code quality is fundamental to the success of any project.
